# My work portfolio

This project has the intention to be a kind of CV regarding my
Information Technology skills. To build it i just used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Vanilla flavor. Not that I don't know
how to work with them. Each one of the items on the section Projects has been carefully selected
in order to convey a clear idea about my skills. The idea is that this page reflects what I have 
done and how do I understand this great digital world we all live in.
